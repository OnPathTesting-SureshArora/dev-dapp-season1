# DevDapp Season 1

Welcome to DevDapp! The GitHub Incentives Layer built on RAIRprotocol. With DevDapp you can earn tokens for contributing to our open-source! Connect your GitHub. Track Contributions. Earn RAIR + partner tokens. 

# How DevDapp Works
RAIRprotocol is a Dapp building engine. By completing the initial 8 tasks in DevDapp you'll earn tokens and learn how to deploy a working Dapp! 

1. If you haven't done so yet, the first step to start playing is by logging in with your GitHub account on [DevDapp.com](Https://devdapp.com). This creates your in-game account and is necessary for tracking your progression.
2. Next, you need to select a task. Scroll down on DevDapp.com and locate the "Tasks" section. Here you can watch an introductory video for the task and you'll find a link to the GitHub tutorial to help you complete it.

3. Complete the task.
4. Make a new issue in the GitHub for your task. The tutorial will show you how to format your proof of completion.
5. If everything checks out, you will receive a label on your task showing you have completed the task. This will update your profile on DevDapp.com with your new levels.
6. Keep playing to earn more levels and climb the leaderboards to earn your share of the $60k prize pool. Prizes are distributed at the end of the season (May 2025).
From there the sky is the limit to build your own Dapp. Or join a team to help them build their dapps. In this first season you are automatically added to the DevDapp team by default. Teams will be expanded in later seasons.

# Rewards

Season 1 rewards are 50,000,000 RAIR + bonus partner tokens!! Season 1 starts now through May 2025. Join early to have more time to complete tasks. Your rewards will be held in an abstracted Alchemy smart wallet that is connected to your GitHub account and will be released to you at the end of the season.
