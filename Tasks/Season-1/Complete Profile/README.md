15. Provide the URL to your devdapp.com profile in the example format below.

## Completion
Once validated, you'll get the "Completed Profile" label. If there’s an issue, you’ll see "Unresolved"—edit until corrected. Do not submit multiple issues. If your issue disappears, it was validated and closed. Sort by closed issues to check.
