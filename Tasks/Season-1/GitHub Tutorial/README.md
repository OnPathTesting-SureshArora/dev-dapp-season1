GitHub issues track progress, plan work, and discuss tasks. You’ll use them often in Open-Source projects. For this task, create an issue and paste the provided text.

## Steps
1. Go to the Issues tab in dev-dapp-season1.
2. Click "New Issue" (green button).
3. Title it "1. Github Tutorial".
4. Copy-paste the text below into the body.
5. Click "Create" (green button).

## Example Issue Body
```
I agree to the rules - let's play!

This first task will introduce you to our game mechanics

1. Submit an issue that follows the guidelines

2. Admins will review and apply labels

3. Labels = Points. Don't submit more than once or you'll be banned.

4. Points = Real $$ including cash, partner tokens and our token (RAIR) at the end of the season
```

## Completion
Once done, admins validate your task. If correct, you get the "Entered" label. If there's an issue, you get "Unresolved"—edit your issue until corrected. Do not submit multiple issues. If your issue disappears, it was validated and closed. Sort by closed issues to check.
