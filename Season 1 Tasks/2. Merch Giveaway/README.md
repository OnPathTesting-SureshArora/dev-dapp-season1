## 2. Merch Giveaway
This year we are a very proud sponsor of the [ETHDome](https://ethdo.me/) at [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/), and [HackIndia](https://hackindia.xyz/), India's Biggest Web3 & AI hackathon series. In celebration of this tremendous honor, we are going to be giving away free DevDapp merch to users who complete this task.

There will be two different prize pools, one for attendees of EthDenver, and another for participants of HackIndia. Please pay attention to the rules so you sign up for the correct pool. 

Not attending? Thats ok! You still earn levels for completing this task and your choice will help us stock up on what you want for future giveaways. Just fill out the task as if you were attending EthDenver.

## EthDenver Participants
Complete the task and paste the text below to receive the correct label on your issue. Then come find us at the EthDome during EthDenver and show us your issue (If it has been successfully completed it will be filed under "closed").

## HackIndia Participants
Due to distance, supplies will be limited so we are going to run a raffle for merch winners. Complete your task and paste the provided text below to receive the correct label on your issue. 

## Whats Up For Grabs?
We have three items you can claim! The first is our DevDapp T-Shirt (in white or black).

Finally, since the theme of this years ETHDome is 'The Regenerate Superhero Hideout', you (or someone you know) can be a Hero with your own DevDapp cape!

## Steps
1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-season1/issues) tab in the dev-dapp-season1 repository
2. Click "New Issue" (the green button).
3. Add a title to your issue. In this case your title should read "2. Merch Giveaway"
4. Depending on your attendance, copy-paste one of the lines below in the body of your new issue.

For EthDenver Attendees:
```
Im going to ETHDenver, I want some DevDapp swag ! 
```
For HackIndia Participants:
```
Im with HackIndia, sign me up for the raffle ! 
```
6. Click "Create" (the green button)

Upon completion, your task will be validated and if it is correct, you will be assigned the "Giveaway Entered", or "Raffle Entered" label. If there is an issue, you will see the "Unresolved" label, this means there is a problem that needs to be corrected. Edit your issue and follow the guidelines more closely until you receive your label. Do not create multiple issues for the same task. If you dont see your issue, it means it has been validated and closed. Verify this by setting the sort settings to show closed issues.
