## 2. Merch Giveaway
This year we are a very proud sponsor of the [ETHDome](https://ethdo.me/) at [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) February 23 - March 2, 2025 in Denver, Colorado. In celebration of this tremendous honor, we are going to be giving away free DevDapp merch to users who complete this task and attend the conference! Not attending? Thats ok! You still earn levels for completing this task and your choice will help us stock up on what you want for future giveaways.

## Whats Up For Grabs?
We have three items you can claim! The first is our DevDapp T-Shirt (in white or black).

Next is a DevDapp branded USB C hub.

Finally, since the theme of this years ETHDome is 'The Regenerate Superhero Hideout', you (or someone you know) can be a Hero with your own DevDapp cape!

## Steps
1. Pick one(1) of the items above that you would like to receive.
2. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-season1/issues) tab in the dev-dapp-season1 repository
3. Click "New Issue" (the green button).
4. Add a title to your issue. In this case your title should read "2. Merch Giveaway"
5. Depending on your choice, copy-paste one of the lines below in the body of your new issue, and edit it with your single choice.
```
I want a DevDapp T-Shirt! 
```
```
I want a DevDapp USB Hub! 
```
```
I want a DevDapp Cape! 
```
6. Click "Create" (the green button)

Upon completion, your task will be validated and if it is correct, you will be assigned the "DevDapp T-Shirt", "DevDapp USB Hub", or "DevDapp Cape" label. If there is an issue, you will see the "Unresolved" label, this means there is a problem that needs to be corrected. Edit your issue and follow the guidelines more closely until you receive your label. Do not create multiple issues for the same task. If you dont see your issue, it means it has been validated and closed. Verify this by setting the sort settings to show closed issues.

7. Come find us at the ETHDome in Denver and show us your completed task and label to receive your Swag.
