## 7. New Dapp
So far we have introduced you to GitHub, showed you how to deploy RAIR to Akash, installed our own RPC nodes, deployed our own smart contracts, but why? The Goal of DevDapp is to help us to improve our open source. The tasks we developed in this first season are ancillary to this goal. The point being that we teach you enough about our project that you will be interested in developing it on your own. This is the goal of any true Open-Source project. What makes DevDapp different is we are attempting to incentivize developer contributions by offering a tangible reward, rather than relying simply on the inherent kindness which is implied by the very broad Open-Source ethos. We want you to have your cake, and eat it too.

In this task, we want to see who can rise to the challenge of using our Open-Source RAIR-Dapp to make something new and interesting. We're not asking for anything crazy, theres only a little over 2 months before the season ends so we can keep things reasonable. What we are mainly looking for is:
1. A new/modified front end.
2. A new and interesting feature or integration.
3. Some kind of unique blockchain functionality.
4. Deployed on SSL enabled cloud server. 
Rather than this being the end of our game, think of this as the beginning of your new Dapp. Have fun. If you have any questions, feel free to join our Discord and we will do our best to help you.

## Some Extra Help
We realize you are kind of jumping into the deep-end with this one 

## Steps


To round things out we just need to create a new issue:
1. Make new issuev New Dapp - Dapp Name
2. Description
3. Link to URL of new dapp
4. 
17. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-season1/issues) tab in the dev-dapp-season1 repository
18. Click "New Issue" (the green button).
19. Add a title to your issue. In this case your title should read "6. EVM Deploy"
20. Copy-paste the text below and add the [Sepolia Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io) link of your deployed ```RAIR20``` contract.

```
My RAIR20 Etherscan link is [https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xAddress].
```
6. Click "Create" (the green button)

Upon completion, your task will be validated and if it is correct, you will be assigned the "EVM Deploy" label. If there is an issue, you will see the "Unresolved" label, this means there is a problem that needs to be corrected. Edit your issue and follow the guidelines more closely until you receive your "EVM Deploy" label. Do not create multiple issues for the same task. If you dont see your issue, it means it has been validated and closed. Verify this by setting the sort settings to show closed issues.

Congratulations! Continue with the next task to earn levels and climb the leaderboard to earn your share of the rewards!
