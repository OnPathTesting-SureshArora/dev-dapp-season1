## 6. Modify Dapp
The ultimate goal of this season is for you to deploy your own working Dapp by utilizing our Open-Source RAIR application. RAIR comes pre-built with a ton of cool features including EVM support, custom Smart Contracts, NFT minting and marketplace capabilities, Streaming video with built-in NFT DRM protection, and more! We have designed DevDapp to help you learn and understand how to get your own Dapp up and running as easily as possible so you can focus on making something unique, without having to do all the heavy lifting. Don't let that discourage you from going nuts though. Because we are Open-Source, you can modify the code in any way you like. The sky is the limit!

## Steps
1. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-season1/issues) tab in the dev-dapp-season1 repository
2. Click "New Issue" (the green button).
3. Add a title to your issue. In this case your title should read "1. Github Tutorial"
4. Read first, then copy-paste the text below in the body of your new issue.

```

```
5. Click "Create" (the green button)

Upon completion, your task will be validated and if it is correct, you will be assigned the "Entered" label. If there is an issue, you will see the "Unresolved" label, this means there is a problem that needs to be corrected. Edit your issue and follow the guidelines more closely until you receive your "Entered" label. Do not create multiple issues for the same task. If you dont see your issue, it means it has been validated and closed. Verify this by setting the sort settings to show closed issues.

Congratulations! You have just created your first issue and are officially entered into DevDapp. Continue with the next task to earn levels and climb the leaderboard to earn your share of the rewards!
