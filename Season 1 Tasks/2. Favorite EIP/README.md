## 2. Favorite EIP
This initial task is for those who are new to GitHub and Ethereum.\
\
This task is a twist on the previous one (see [1. Github Tutorial](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-season1/tree/main/Season%201%20Tasks/1.%20GitHub%20Tutorial) if you have not completed it yet). Again we are asking you to create an issue, but this time we want you to delve into Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP). RAIRprotocol utilizes its own Smart Contracts deployed to the Ethereum network for transactions; as such it behooves one to be a little familiar with the standards of the Ethereum protocol. Who knows, maybe you'll be inspired to start writing your own Smart Contracts after seeing just whats possible! Even better, RAIRprotocol allows for deployment of custom Smart Contracts, meaning you dont have to use ours, you can deploy your own Smart Contracts to the RAIR dApp you're learning to build!

## Steps
1. Navigate to https://eips.ethereum.org/ and take a look around. EIPs are organized by type, so find one which is most interesting to you.
2. Navigate to the [Issues](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-season1/issues) tab in the dev-dapp-season1 repository
3. Click "New Issue" (the green button).
4. Add a title to your issue. In this case your title should read "2. Favorite EIP"
5. Copy-paste the text below in the body of your new issue, and edit it according to our requests.
6. Click "Create" (the green button)

```
I checked out Ethereum Improvement Proposals! My Favorite new EIP is [Write EIP here].

The reason I like this EIP is [Write a short description why, this helps us understand what features we might want to implement in the future to our own smart contracts!]
```
Upon completion, your task will be validated and if it is correct, you will be assigned the "Favorite EIP" label. If there is an issue, you will see the "Unresolved" label, this means there is a problem that needs to be corrected. Edit your issue and follow the guidelines more closely until you receive your "Favorite EIP" label. Do not create multiple issues for the same task. If you dont see your issue, it means it has been validated and closed. Verify this by setting the sort settings to show closed issues.

Congratulations! Continue with the next task to earn levels and climb the leaderboard to earn your share of the rewards!
