## Tasks Help ##
Here you will find useful information for completing tasks for each season of DevDapp. Tasks do not have to be completed in a linear fashion, but the difficulty (and hence levels earned) scales with each one. Our aim is to be accessable to both new and seasoned developers, so if a task is too simple for you, feel free to skip it and move on to another (More difficult tasks begin at #4). For a more detailed description (relative difficulty, potential levels earned), leaderboards, and to edit your user profile please check out [DevDapp.com](https://devdapp.com), and dont forget to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nxVB2M4rWq) for further support and the latest updates!
