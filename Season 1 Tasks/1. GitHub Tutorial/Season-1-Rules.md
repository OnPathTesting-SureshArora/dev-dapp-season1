## How DevDapp Works
![Banner](https://github.com/rairprotocol/dev-dapp-s1/blob/main/devdapp-assets/gameloop.png)
By signing into DevDapp, users can compete for Rewards by completing tasks. Our tasks, curated by the DevDapp team, will teach you how to deploy, modify, and operate our open-source Dapp building engine.
Upon completion, participants not only earn rewards, but also learn the full process for Web3 application development! +Our community is pretty awesome. 

## Key Terms 

- **Task** - Tasks are assigned a difficulty rating. This range reflects the number of Levels which may be received upon completion of a Task. 

 - **Sponsored Task** - Our partners may offer their technology to further aid in your learning process. These special Tasks may also include bonus Rewards in the form of tokens from each partner.

- **Points** - DevDapp admins assign a raw point value to each task. As you complete tasks you earn points which will level up your profile on the Leaderboard. 

- **Level** - Raw point value earned for completing Tasks is abstracted from the developer. Instead, developers gain “Levels” upon completion and these Levels are used to place them on the Leaderboard.

- **Leaderboard** - Users earning points are added to the Leaderboard. Top developers earn higher rewards at the end of a Season, but every developer on the Leaderboard receives something just for contributing!

- **Season** - Users complete tasks over the length of a “Season”. Seasons have a set duration period with a start and end date defining the overall length of the Season. The start date is when the Season officially begins, and the end date is used to control the distribution of rewards. Upon completion of a Season, Points are counted and Rewards are distributed accordingly.

- **Reward** - Developers are given a percentage of tokens at the end of a Season for completing as many Tasks as possible. Payouts are given in our native RAIR token (50MM total), as well as any partner tokens they may have accumulated throughout the Season.

## Points Staking and Distribution
At the end of each season, rewards are distributed based on the final Leaderboard. Developers can then choose which date they receive their reward and earn more reward for staking longer.<br><br>

- Participants are ranked by their final level at the end of the Season. 
- There are multiple tiers developers will be ranked into. 
- The top tier is a fixed number of winners.
